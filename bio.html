	<h1>Biography</h1>
		<p>Hey yall,
			I am an aspiring computer scientist at Tufts university and I'm from Bronx, NY. On my spare time I listen to a lot of music and am a DJ on campus. Most of my extracirriculars are focused on assiting minority high school students throughout the entire college process. Whether it be a college tour, working one on one on the essay process, or assisting with the search process, I try my best to make the process more accessible to those that are usually overlooked. As I came from the same place.</p>
